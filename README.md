# DuckService
Windows Service used to update DuckDNS. http://www.duckdns.org/

Uses a service to update DuckDNS. Set and forget. Starts before user login.

To install, download install.zip and follow readme instructions inside.

Tested on Windows 8.1 running .NET framework 4.5. If you want to tell me what system you have and whether or not it works for you, I'd be in your debt.

If you want to donate, I strongly urge you to donate to DuckDNS instead, but here's my link anyway: https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=GBAV99LDWYRZW
